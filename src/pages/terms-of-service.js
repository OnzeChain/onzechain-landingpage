        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to OnzeChain, a website-hosted user interface (the "Interface" or "App") provided by Onzechain. The Interface provides access to a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to trade certain digital assets (the "Protocol"). The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") explains the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Interface. You must read this Agreement carefully. By accessing or using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Interface and should not use the Interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          NOTICE: Please read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use of the Interface. This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. The Interface is only available to you — and you should only access the Interface — if you agree completely with these terms.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Eligibility
        </h4>
        <p>
          To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., eighteen years old) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Proprietary Rights
        </h4>
        <p>
          We own all intellectual property and other rights in the Interface and its contents, including (but not limited to) software, text, images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and designs. This intellectual property is available under the terms of our copyright licenses and our Trademark Guidelines. Unlike the Interface, versions 1-3 of the protocol are comprised entirely of open-source or source-available software running on the public Ethereum blockchain.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Privacy
        </h4>
        <p>
          When you use the Interface, the only information we collect from you is your blockchain wallet address, completed transaction hashes, and the token names, symbols, or other blockchain identifiers of the tokens that you swap. We do not collect any personal information from you (e.g., your name or other identifiers that can be linked to you).
        </p>
        <h4>
          Prohibited Activity
        </h4>
        <p>
          You agree not to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the following categories of prohibited activity in relation to your access and use of the Interface:
        </p>
        <p>
          Intellectual Property Infringement. Activity that infringes on or violates any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy, or other proprietary or intellectual property rights under the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyberattack. Activity that seeks to interfere with or compromise the integrity, security, or proper functioning of any computer, server, network, personal device, or other information technology system, including (but not limited to) the deployment of viruses and denial of service attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fraud and Misrepresentation. Activity that seeks to defraud us or any other person or entity, including (but not limited to) providing any false, inaccurate, or misleading information in order to unlawfully obtain the property of another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Market Manipulation. Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation concerning the integrity of trading markets, including (but not limited to) the manipulative tactics commonly known as spoofing and wash trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Securities and Derivatives Violations. Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation concerning the trading of securities or derivatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any Other Unlawful Conduct. Activity that violates any applicable law, rule, or regulation of the United States or another relevant jurisdiction, including (but not limited to) the restrictions and regulatory requirements imposed by U.S. law.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice
        </h4>
        <p>
          You agree and understand that all trades you submit through the Interface are considered unsolicited, which means that you have not received any investment advice from us in connection with any trades, including those you place via our Auto Router API, and that we do not conduct a suitability review of any trades you submit.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Assumption of Risk
        </h4>
        <p>
          By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20). In particular, you understand that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Entire Agreement
        </h4>
        <p>
          These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings (if any) relating to the subject matter of the terms.        </p>
